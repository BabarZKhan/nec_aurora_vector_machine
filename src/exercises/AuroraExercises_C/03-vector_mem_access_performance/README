| Vector Memory Access Performance |
+----------------------------------+

During compilation the compiler creates different vector instructions from your loops.
This exercise's only purpose is to show for a selected set of loops what operations
are generated and how they perform.

Task:
   1 - Build and run
       - Compile test with make
       - Run on Aurora
         time ./test.x
       - Check ftrace 
         ftrace -detail -f ftrace.out > test.ftrace

   2 - Read the ftrace file test.ftrace and test.L to get a hold of the different generated
       instructions from the nfort compiler.
       Nothing to optimize here, but you may check a loop construct of your choice.
       Remember to put it inside an ftrace region to be accurately measured.
