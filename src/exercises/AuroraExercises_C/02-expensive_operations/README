| Expensive Operations |
+----------------------+

Vectorization independent, certain operations are more expensive than others.

Task:
   1 - Build and run
       - Compile test with make
       - Run on Aurora
         time ./test.x
       - Check ftrace 
         ftrace -detail -f ftrace.out > test.ftrace

   2 - Go through all routines in vec.c from do_comp1 to do_comp7
       and replace or rearrange the expensive operations to increase the performance.
      
       1. Recall the comparison from exercise 01 regarding the different costs of operations.
       
       2. The routine do_comp6 can be made even faster by precomputing
          the sum of square roots.
          However, while mathematically equivalent, due to change in the
          order of operations, the numerical results differ slightly.
          It is the programmers responsibility to decide whether or not
          a change in numerics is worth the speedup in such cases.
