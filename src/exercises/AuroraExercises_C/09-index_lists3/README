| Index List 3 |
+--------------+

While the use of index lists can improve performance, index lists always represent 
indirect addressing and should only be used when necessary.
In this exercise the task is to replace the used index lists, which contain specific
patterns, with a direct addressing method.

Task:
   1 - Build and run
       - Compile test with make
       - Run on Aurora
         time ./test.x
       - Check ftrace 
         ftrace -detail -f ftrace.out > test.ftrace

   2 - Inspect the index lists in test.c.
       Note that both of them are constructed using specific patterns.
       Remove the unnecessary index lists from test.c and use a
       direct addressing method in vec.c
