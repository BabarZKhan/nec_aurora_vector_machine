Vectorization of loops often results in huge performance increase. 
Some operations prohibit automated vectorization and require a reformulation
of the loop or additional compiler flags.

Task:
   1 - Build and run
       - Compile test with make
       - Run on Aurora
         time ./test.x
       - Check ftrace 
         ftrace -detail -f ftrace.out > test.ftrace

   2 - Compare your ftrace with the ftrace of the solution.
       The ftrace file shows that for loop1-4 the 
       vector operation ratio (V.OP RATIO), and
       the average vector length are both zero.
       Comparing the Vector time (always zero) with the exclusive time shows that 
       the complete code was executed in scalar.
       (This is the best measure in order to check for scalar code parts)
       Check the test.L file to figure out why each of the loops could not be vectorized.
       Rewrite each block, or change the compiler flags in the Makefile
       The average vector length in loop5 looks fine, but can still be improved.
       such that the compiler is able to vectorize it better.
