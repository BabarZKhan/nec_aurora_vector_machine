| Operation Performance |
+-----------------------+

Elementary operations and mathematical functions differ strongly in their execution time.
This exercise's only purpose is to show the cost of a selected set of operations
compared to other operations.

Task:
   1 - Build and run
       - Compile test with make
       - Run on Aurora
         time ./test.x
       - Check ftrace 
         ftrace -detail -f ftrace.out > test.ftrace

   2 - Read the ftrace file test.ftrace to get a hold of the different costs
       of functions on the Aurora system.
       Nothing to optimize here, but you may check a function or operation of you choice.
       Remember to put it inside an ftrace region to be accurately measured.
