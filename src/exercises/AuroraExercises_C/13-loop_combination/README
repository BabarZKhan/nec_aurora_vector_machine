| Loop Combination |
+------------------+

Often successive loop structures work on the same set of data.
This results in the same data beeing loaded over and over again
and slowing down the computation.
Combinination of loop structures reduces the number of requried loads
thus improving performance.

Task:
   1 - Build and run
       - Compile test with make
       - Run on Aurora
         time ./test.x
       - Check ftrace 
         ftrace -detail -f ftrace.out > test.ftrace

   2 - Combine the two loops in the routine do_comp in the file vec.c into one loop.
       Be careful with the iteration count, as both loops differ in this respect.
       Split of the parts, which are only done in one loop.
